      # What’s New
      Nebula Code Academy is thrilled to announce that it has been selected as a recipient of the **2025 EdTech Innovation Grant**, a program backed by leading global education investors and tech foundations. Starting this fall, the grant will power the introduction of AI-driven interactive learning tools, including adaptive quiz challenges, real-time feedback on coding exercises, and a personalized learning roadmap.

      ## Background
      The EdTech Innovation Grant is designed to support forward-thinking education platforms. It evaluates applicants based on innovation, scalability, and impact. Nebula’s proposal, which highlighted the use of AI to make coding more engaging, inclusive, and tailored to individual learners, stood out among dozens of applicants.

      ## Why It Matters
      This funding allows Nebula to deliver an even more dynamic learning experience tailored to each student’s pace and style. The AI enhancements will:
      - Offer instant code feedback, reducing frustration and accelerating learning
      - Recommend next-best lessons based on performance and learning history
      - Provide accessible helpers for students who learn in diverse contexts, whether they’re in Kano, Lagos, or beyond

      > **Insight**  
      > “Adaptive learning is the future. With this grant, Nebula can meet students where they are, and take them further than ever imagined.”  
      > — *Dr. Folake Adebayo, Lead Education Technologist, Nebula*

      ## Career-Ready Skills in a Changing Industry
      Building the next generation of developers isn’t just about teaching syntax—it’s about curating experiences that adapt, respond, and support students. With AI-powered learning tools, Nebula equips students to become confident coders, critical thinkers, and agile problem solvers—exactly the kind of talent top tech firms seek.

      # What’s New
      According to recent job data published by *Business Insider*, roles like **UI/UX designer** and **prompt engineer** are among the fastest-growing tech careers in **2025**, and many companies no longer require a formal CS degree to apply. Hiring managers now prioritize **portfolios**, **design thinking**, and fluency with tools like **Figma**, **Notion**, and **AI content structuring** over traditional credentials.

      A report from LinkedIn’s *Emerging Jobs* list also noted a **40% increase** in demand for **design-focused AI professionals** and **AI prompt specialists** across marketing, education, and SaaS.

      ## Background
      **Prompt engineering** involves crafting clear, effective instructions for AI models like ChatGPT or Claude, and it’s becoming critical in teams building user-facing tools, chatbots, or generative content apps.

      Meanwhile, **UI/UX designers** are shaping AI-integrated journeys — from onboarding flows to chatbot interfaces. Because these careers rely on **creativity, empathy, and iterative design**, they’re accessible entry points for students from diverse backgrounds.

      ## Why It Matters
      At a time when automation threatens many traditional tech roles, these careers highlight the growing need for **human-centered, creative thinkers** who can work *with* — not just around — AI systems. For Nebula learners, it’s a clear signal that:

      - You **don’t need to master algorithms** to thrive in tech  
      - **Soft skills + visual storytelling + tool mastery = real career potential**  
      - **Systems thinking** is as valuable as learning to code

      ## Insight
      > “I didn’t come from a coding background, but I love design. Now I build AI chat flows that talk to real customers.”  
      > — *Ifunanya, UI/UX Designer & Prompt Engineer, Lagos*

      ## Career-Ready Skills in a Changing Industry
      As companies blend AI tools with user-facing experiences, they’re hiring students who can **ask good questions**, **map clean flows**, and **build responsive, accessible designs**. Roles like **prompt engineer**, **UX writer**, **AI content architect**, and **visual interface designer** are no longer niche — they’re critical.

      **Nebula’s curriculum** is evolving to meet that demand with hands-on projects in:

      - **UI/UX and product design**  
      - **AI prompting and no-code flows**  
      - **Prototyping with Figma, Webflow, and Notion AI**
